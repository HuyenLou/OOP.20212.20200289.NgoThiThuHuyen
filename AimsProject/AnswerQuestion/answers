Question:
1.After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two
objects still remain?
Answer : As we swap 2 object through tmp,  Only the method
references are swap,
not the original
references.Java creates a copy of the variable being passed in the method and then do the manipulations. Hence the change is not reflected in the main method.
2.After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is
the title of the JungleDVD changed?
