Question:
- Create an ArrayList of Media, then add some media (CD, DVD, or Book) to the list.
- Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using the toString() method.
Observe what happens and explain it in detail.

Answer:
with 3 different types of media ( book,cd,dvd),even though they are calling the same method(toString()) 
but for each type, the results are different and appropriate for each object information.
Explain:
because for each class( Book, CompactDisc, DigitalVideoDisc), we have overridden the method toString 
so that it is appropriate for each class. we have achieved the polymorphism of toString() method.
